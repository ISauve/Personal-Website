iOS app for people with Celiac's disease (or for people trying to find food for someone with Celiac's):
    - user takes a picture of a list of ingredients (or chooses an image from their phone)
    - app uses Google Cloud Vision API (OCR) to detect and extract text in the image
    - raw data gets sent via POST request to the classification API
    - API uses Express JS to receive the data and communicate it with Node.js
    - pulls data re: safety of different ingredients from a Redis database
    - parses the raw data, determining which ingredients are 'safe', which are 'unsafe', and which are 'risky'
    - draw conclusions based on this data about whether someone with Celiac's should be eating this food
    - sends all this data back to the app to be displayed to the user

- my job: building the back end (classification API)
- tools I used: Node.js/ExpressJS/Redis
